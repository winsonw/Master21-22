    "In the main text, the cental limit theorem is mentioned. This theorem, somewhat loosely stated, implies that\n",
    "a sum comprised of $N$ terms of stochastic variables, will be distributed approximately according to a normal distribution, even if distribution if the stochastic variables themselves are sampled from a distribution that is not a Guassian. It is assumed that all variables are governed by the same distribution and are independent. The mean and variance of the Gaussian can be estimated in terms of the mean and variance of the non-Gaussian distribution and $N$. \n",

According to the central limit theorem this mean itself follows a distribution that is approximately Gaussian. In this activity, we will simulate  the mean of samples of various distributions and will demonstrate that this indeed follows a \n",
